   <h2>Data and algorithms</h2>
   <p class="inicioparagrafo">The <q>Data Society Research Seminar: Behind Data and Algorithms – Actors,logics and cultures behind digital technologies</q> took place last week on 16 June at <span class="bold1"> Malmö University </span>. There to speak at the event were <span class="redtext1"> Andrea Rosales Climent </span> and 
   <span class="redtext1"> Sara Suárez-Gonzalo</span> ,researchers from the <span class="bold1"> IN3 </span>. The seminar was organized by <span class="bold1"> Malmö University’s University’s Data Society research programme. </span> </p>

   <p class="inicioparagrafo">Data and algorithms are intensively put in the public eye and have been on the research agenda for some time,
     prompting studies on biased systems regarding gender, ethnicity and now age. Researching the actors, logic and 
     cultures behind data can lead academics to key insights into how algorithms embody rules, furthering discussions 
     on power in today’s data society.</p>
     <p class="inicioparagrafo">Over the last 20 years, digital technology and the internet have completely changed our mindsets. The internet was 
    initially seen as a new world of amazing capabilities, but the digital revolution now threatens to undermine values such as personal 
    freedom, democracy, trustworthy knowledge and even open competition. The future looks more like a dystopian universe than a utopian digital world. 
    Words like monopoly, surveillance and disinformation describe the most pressing problems in this rather fearful internet setting. It sometimes feels like
     we live in a technological regime where our privacy is not respected anymore. In order to have any hope of recovering the promise of new technology, 
     these problems need to be fixed.</p>

<blockquote id="quotation">
  <p>The concept of surveillance capitalism has been used and popularized by sociologist <span class="othercolor"> Shoshana Zuboff </span>. It refers to the commodification of personal data, i.e. the transformation of personal information into merchandise that is put up for sale to make a profit.</p>

  <h2>Data domination: the effects of mass surveillance </h2>
  <p class="inicioparagrafo"> <span class="redtext1"> Sara Suárez-Gonzalo </span> focused her talk on explaining how neo-republican 
    theory can help us to better understand and deal with the effects of big data exploitation, mass surveillance
     and the way they shape social power relations.</p>
    <p class="inicioparagrafo"> The hegemonic framework for the discussion of the social and political effects of data-driven technologies 
    is the liberal conception of the values of privacy and freedom (traditionally defined by liberalism as non-interference).</p>

  <h2>A new perspective </h2>
  <p class="inicioparagrafo">There is no control of privacy nowadays; this is seen in the need to accept cookies from regular websites to 
    do any daily task on a computer. Surveillance strips people of control over their freedom to remain private, 
    thus taking away their right to privacy. Overcoming data domination will mean defying the liberal hegemonic conception 
    of privacy and accepting that leaving people alone to do as they please is not enough. We need to rethink a possible feminist 
    and neo-republican perspective. For that, <span class="redtext1"> Suárez-Gonzalo </span> proposed
    two conditions:</p>

<ul class="listimages">
   <li class="mundo1"> Everyone must be provided with the material and immaterial resources necessary to keep the potential 
    forms of domination in check. This means guaranteeing universal education on digital issues and bridging the digital divides affecting 
    some parts of the population that are unable to keep up with technological development. </li>
   <li class="mundo1"> Structural conditions, such as restrictions of policy, that give control to big tech companies
     must be avoided. This means preventing them from exercising their power on public institutions and imposing restrictions 
     on the monopolistic dynamics of the economy that guide the technological business model.</li>
</ul>
